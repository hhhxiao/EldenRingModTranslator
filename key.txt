------
are you... are you the tarnished? the elden lord?
------
oh, thank you, 玛莉卡!
------
i have been waiting for you to come here for so much time...
------
please, listen to me. i have something urgent to tell you!
------
one day i - be great chance - found a secret entrance to a peculiar looking tower, hidden in a forest.
------
curious as i am, i entered and started to explore.
------
there was no soul around and for some time i even thought the place was abandoned...
------
and what i have found was... tons of blueprints, projects, papers...
------
about weapons, armors... so many items i have never seen.
------
and be ware that i am an experienced blacksmith. and those things... they don't belong to our world...
------
i chose to grab those blueprints, thinking they had been abandoned there... but actually a 魔力 alarm loudly exploded.
------
i had to flee fast, before somebody could come and see me.
------
after a week of travelling, i  found a little corner where to hide. i then proceeded to check my documents and that was when i realized who i had indeed robbed.
------
the 圣诗班... an institution i've never heard of. but judging what i have in my hands, they must be a deadly threat.
------
i forged as many weapons as i can, hoping to find something to protect myself, but i am not enough skilled to wield any of these, so i chose to sell them.
------
at first i thought of selling them in all of the 交界地, or maybe sell the blueprints...
------
but the moment i was about to set up my business, a fine looking girl warned me that i would put myselft in danger so she instructed to come here.
------
that fine girl told me i'd be safe here and that nobody will find me,
------
she told me about the tarnished, the only befit to wield these weapons of mine.
------
she commanded me to stop talking, to be quiet for several days, cause the 圣诗班 could hear me.
------
i now live to sell wares and survive one more day.
------
as for the weapons, i made them available in your crafting kit.
------
majestic elden lord, your people are calling your name! your fair rule is threatened by the illegitimate claims of the old aristocracy!
------
a battle has been raging for days in your new capital, tarneria, where we all gathered after your victory against the old dynasty.
------
please, they will soon invade the lower city! protect us!
------
some years ago the new 污秽之血族 arrived.
------
they calimed they were here to protect our land from evil creatures, yet none was seen before their arrival.
------
they require we pay them tributes and punish us if we don't...
------
i wanted to escape, to flee so i waited here for the carriage to leave.
------
it's been days... please, i'll die if i stay here!
------
i escaped the public prison below the vileblood chapel. all of my friends died by the hand of that crazy prisoner...
------
i don't even know why i'm here. the knights captured me and accused me of stealing soldiers' rations.
------
there's a pyre over there. were they planning to burn me alive?
------
i can see their wizards search for me.
------
soon, they'll find me.
------
i don't wanna die.
------
it's over.
------
starting today, i'll be the monster they accused me of being. i'll kill. i'll take everybody's life...
------
whoever's thrown into this cell i will eliminate and feast on their bodies.
------
death to 安娜丽瑟 ii and the 污秽之血族.
------
see you in hell.
------
remainings of an unborn child, by her mother's body.
------
they both fell victim of the beasts that now roam the village.
------
this is a human eye. it was removed from the socket of the owner.
------
it is cold, almost frozen.
------
probably removed as a form of torture by the new 污秽之血族.
------
this is a human tongue. it seems like it was ripped off from the victim of the new 污秽之血族.
------
it is covered in a yellow substance. maybe, an acid.
------
to lord aeneas
------
of all the rebels captured in the last 7 days, 6 have been succesfully burned. the rest are waiting for their execution in the catacombs.
------
runes were correctly aquired, saved and delivered to her majesty, 安娜丽瑟 ii, queen of the new 污秽之血族.
------
as for the 卢恩熊s, we struggle to find more speciemens fit to our purposes and we are left with the weaker ones only. we request an assembly to discuss the matter thoroughly.
------
to lord aeneas
------
as you expected, our troops have grown comfortable with the new weapons you crafted. military drills show great proficiency for all of our soldiers and great reaction times, too. the castle is safe.
------
realistically, we should not expect any sudden attack by the elden school, as they are probably still mending their wounds and definitely keeping a low profile.
------
none of us wants a new clash right now and i suggest we keep a low profile as well.
------
i am not implying we leave roderick's 火把 to them. i believe it's best to focus on technical development so that they cannot ever be a match to us.
------
auselius, lethal enemy of the vileblood and the orthodox doctrine, is rumored of being sick. sick because of his own weapon.
------
such a pathetic man!
------
he dared to challenge us with insight and frenzy... but look what he is now... an empty shell!
------
aeneas' the future of the new 污秽之血族.
------
i taught him everything i learnt from my father, roderick.
------
i told him about the stories my father would tell me, about old cainhurst.
------
he used to be an apprentice blacksmith. he was not allowed to touch, yet he could see the increadible vileblood weapons.
------
at last, the castle was conquered, the queen left to stare at the vileblood corpses. roderick managed to flee the country.
------
i used not to believe what he told me what happened next...
------
"kneel afore us (圣诗班: or get thee gone)
------
if thou wouldst this path walk (圣诗班: i prithee partake of my rotted blood)
------
for the honor of cainhurst (圣诗班: for the honor of cainhurst)"
------
note: this is what the elder told me her father heard queen 安娜丽瑟 the first say. it should work pretty well during mass.
------
presenting himself as a stateless person, roderick, my father, was hosted by the healing church nearby cathedral ward among the many, filthy beggars the church housed.
------
one day, while taking a walk in the courtyard, he was moved up in the sky and in an instant the environment surrounding him changed.
------
he found himself in this kingdom, the 交界地, and, unable to find a way home, he settled here.
------
considering the 污秽之血族 had been exterminated, he relized what an opportunity he had here, far from danger, to build a new community: the new 污秽之血族.
------
roderick, my own father, chose to start anew. using his blacksmith knowledge, he was able to build a small fortune which he used to build feudal ties and grew an army.
------
he taught them the vileblood way of life and they believed. a community was born. it was now missing a place to call home.
------
so they wandered for a year and finally found this region. after persuading the local population, the new 污秽之血族 built a castle and a fortress.
------
this region is now called new cainhurst.
------
it belongs to us.
------
soon, i'll take over cainhurst.
------
once the queen dies, the old generation will be completely gone and i'll be able to follow my own startegy.
------
i never truested her take, to let the elden school go.
------
what they did to us... it is unconceivable.
------
to stab our backs, here of all the places... at home... their own home...
------
安娜丽瑟 let it go. i won't.
------
egregious andrew.
------
we are sorry to hear about your setbacks. after the fall of the ruling dynasty of the 交界地, your extraordinary competence in the matter of diplomacy has failed to provide you a sufficient source of income.
------
master guglielmo would love to meet you to discuss the terms of a new accord.
------
please, come and greet our legate in 亚楠. she will escort you to our capital.
------
oh, void one, forgive me. i fell for carnal desire,
------
i consumed him, devoured him. the beast in me won me, even if briefly.
------
my shame shall be everlasting.
------
multiple are the consequences of my offence: the 圣诗班 won't have its diplomat; the diplomat has been conquered by the beast blood.
------
soon i will face the same fate. how long until i cannot cover any of this?
------
void one, forgive me... protect me...
------
this document reveals the exact location of josefka's clinic's site of grace. it is now visible on map.
------
in the clinic, obscure experiments on the subject of beast blood are being made. the elden school regularly provides the 圣诗班 with lab rats, usualy the poorest of the 交界地.
------
亚楠 is a city unheard of in the whole kingdom. yet, it seems to be very populous and rich. as for salubrity, that's another thing.
------
san guglielmo
------
this is carletto, reporting from the city of bononia. the local ruler, auselius, confirms his interest in reaffirming the cooperation with the 圣诗班.
------
apparently, building an embassy was the right choice: people are taking interest in the matter of the great ones and the local government is available to send their representatives to rumona.
------
moreover, a portal is in the process of being created, to connect bononia to 亚楠.
------
that is all i can say.
------
may the good blood guide your way.
------
i, auselius, leader of the elden school, agree to host you in my beautiful bononia.
------
as discussed earlier, we will provide you with hospitaly and power until you can get the capital city back.
------
i took your words very seriously: in this foreign world, where nothing is by me known, where even brothers betray each other, the idea that a sudden change of governance in favor of an unknown soldier is definitely frightening.
------
we shall join forces to find and remove the elden lord from the throne of the 交界地.

like a true revelation, this uncanny relic defies understanding
------
it is almost time to strike. auselius has lost his 集中力: he accepted so easily to cooperate with complete strangers. first the rebels of the new ruling dynasty, then the 圣诗班.
------
that weapon of his... after the battle in cainhurst, auselius has never been the same again.
------
he won't move from piazza maggiore, contemplating and whispering by himself.
------
we brought him his papers and government books, but he won't react to them.
------
it's time that i make a move and give the elden school a proper lead.
------
it is sure convenient that they so easily accepted our friendship, but much more risible is they did not realize the plague grows stronger the more they intertwine with us.
------
it is saddening to see blood covered corpses crying in the streets, and drunk students not realizing they're headed that way, too.
------
but it is much needed for us, as the more the plague spreads in this world, the weaker it is at home.
------
guglielmo, 3465: andrew of 罗德尔 arrives in 亚楠; dines with me; leaves to sleep in a residence. i stay awake all night, feeling uneasy.
------
guglielmo, 3466: andrew and i have official talks at 12 am. we finish at 6:43 pm. i offer myself to escort him to his residence. i drink healing blood before leaving but it is not to cure my discomfort.
------
i trip over and cut my own hand. blood flows and i lose control. we were alone. the beast took over.
------
before i gain consciousness again, his body was slit open.
------
guglielmo, between 3466 and 3467: my consciousness was foggy and i knew i didn't have much time. i swiftly bring him to a famous doctor in central 亚楠, a trusted woman.
------
there is nothing she can do to save him, unless... injecting the healing blood.
------
i knew what cosnequences using healing blood would have, but i ordered as a figure of authority.
------
as i am heading back to the residence, i feel a deadly urge inside of me.
------
i leave the diplomat where i can and flee to the grand cathedral.
------
as i write, i feel like it's over.
------
i'll jump and kill myself, before i finally transform in a beats.
------
forgive me, void one.
------
forgive me, san guglielmo.
------
cosma, i did it! at least 40 students share the same view of yours! they say they'll join us!
------
some of them are young, but we definitely have good numbers!
------
as for me, thanks to a man named andrew, i was able to be hired by the 圣诗班. they sent me their equipment and i've been training day and night!

i know it foreign fashion, but do you believe it would fit a king-consort?
