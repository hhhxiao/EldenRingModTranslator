La procédure d’arbitrage de toute Réclamation concernée par la présente Convention d’arbitrage sera régie par le règlement d’arbitrage commercial de l’American Arbitration Association (« AAA ») et, le cas échéant, les procédures additionnelles du AAA pour les litiges liés aux consommateurs, pouvant tous les deux être consultés à l’adresse : http://www.adr.org.

O procedimento para a arbitragem de qualquer Ação sob este Contrato de Arbitragem será regido pelas Regras de Arbitragem Comercial (Commercial Arbitration Rules) da Associação de Arbitragem Americana (American Arbitration Association, \"AAA\") e, quando aplicável, pelos Procedimentos Complementares para Pleitos Relacionados ao Consumidor (Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes) da AAA, ambos disponíveis em: http://www.adr.org.
