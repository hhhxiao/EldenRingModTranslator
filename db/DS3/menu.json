  "14. dispute resolution/binding arbitration/class action waiver.\n14.1. you and bnea agree to resolve all disputes and claims between you and bnea in individual binding arbitration.  that includes, but is not limited to, any claims arising out of or relating to: (a) any aspect of the relationship between you and bnea; (b) this eula; or (c) your access to and use of the game.  it applies regardless of whether such claims are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.\n14.2. however, this section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or bnea may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.\n14.3. this section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from bnea for you.\n14.4. an arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court and provides more limited discovery.  it follows different rules than court proceedings and is subject to very limited review by courts.  the arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  you understand that you and bnea are giving up the right to sue in court and to have a trial before a judge or jury.\n14.5. you and bnea agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.  a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.  if you and bnea do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or bnea may commence an arbitration.  written notice to bnea must be sent via postal mail to: attn: legal & business affairs department, bandai namco entertainment america inc., 2051 mission college boulevard, santa clara, california 95054, usa. \n14.6. the federal arbitration act applies to this section.  the arbitration will be governed by the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association (“aaa”) and, where applicable, the aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, both of which are available at http://www.adr.org.  the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this eula. \n14.7. the aaa will administer the arbitration.  it may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the country/region where you live or at another mutually agreed location. \n14.8. if you seek $10,000 or less, bnea agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  bnea agrees not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  if you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and bnea according to the aaa commercial arbitration rules and the aaa’s supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes, if applicable. \n14.9. you and bnea agree not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration, even if aaa’s procedures or rules would otherwise allow one.  the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent of that party’s individual claim.  you and bnea also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this eula and all other actions or arbitrations.\n14.10. if the agreement in this section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration should be found illegal or unenforceable, you and bnea agree that it shall not be severable, that this entire section shall be unenforceable, and any claim or dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration. \n14.11. notwithstanding this section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. \n14.12. this section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  if the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this section, notwithstanding section 16 (governing law), such provisions will not apply to you": "%null%",
  "15. governing law.  any dispute not subject to arbitration, or where no election to arbitrate has been made, will be decided by the state or federal court located in santa clara county, california, and you and bnea agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  except as otherwise set forth herein, this eula shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of california and the united states of america, without regard to choice of law or conflict of law principles. the un convention on contracts for the international sale of goods is expressly disclaimed": "%null%",
  "16. miscellaneous. if any provision of this eula is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions will remain in effect and be enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained in the eula.  bnea’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.  you may not assign or transfer this eula or your rights, and any attempt to the contrary is void.  this eula sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between bnea and you with respect to the subject matter": "%null%",
